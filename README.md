# Tim Walz Fixed Your Bicycle

This was *heavily* influenced by Mat Honan's "[Barack Obama Is Your New Bicycle](https://barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com)".

Let's bring back some of that '08 optimism and energy!

## About the Author

If you need someone to do some WordPress work, you can pay Jason to do that for you at [Little Room](https://littleroom.studio). He can make your site fast.

Fun nerd? Member of the media? Just wanna chat?

I've had the username "boogah" over on Gmail for like 20 years now. Drop me a line there. Unless you're some sort of far right weirdo, that is.

I primarily use the fediverse (see: Mastodon) so you could also say hi [there](https://simian.rodeo/@boogah).

Want to make your own version of this site? [Remix it](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tim-walz-fixed-your-bicycle) on Glitch!

Finally, after getting several million visits in a matter of days, I *would not* be mad if you wanted to help me cover the (eventual) costs of running this thing.

You can do so by [buying a t-shirt](https://cottonbureau.com/people/tim-walz-fixed-your-bicycle) or sending along a couple bucks:
